# NAU-jenzabar

The new E-learning plateform of North American is making it a little challenging to keep track of Due works such as assignmnents and quizzes. It doesn't have integrations the calenders yet. And the sign in process alone is not very straight forward
The idea being this repository is to create a scripting program that would scrape relevant information from the NAU Jenzabar plateform and directly post it through API calls to your google Calendar. 

## Pre-requisite: 
* North American University student credentials
* python 3.7 or abobe
* geckdriver.exe saved in a /bin file located in the root folder (download link https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/tag/v0.30.0)
* For packages and dependencies check requirements.txt file
